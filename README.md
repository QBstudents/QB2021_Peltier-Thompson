### Biography  

My name is Danny Peltier, I'm originally from Hawaii but spent most of my life in New Mexico. A fun fact is that I've gotten 2 parasites during fieldwork thus far (hopefully I won't get more but can't rule it out!) In 2018 I graduated from NMSU with a B.S. in Geology with minors in Chemistry and Anthropology and came to IU that fall. I'm now a 3rd year PhD student in EAS working with Dr. Jackson Njau and Dr. Ed Herrmann. My research is very interdisciplinary, merging Geology, Ecology, Anatomy, and Anthropology. I study how tectonic processes like landscape change and volcanism impact the paleoecology through time to better understand the role biotic and abiotic interactions had on hominin evolution. My research area is throughout eastern Africa during the late Cenozoic and I do fieldwork in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania.

### Course Expectations:  

* Become more confident in my coding and general computer skills
* Learn to quantify alpha and beta diversity at different temporal and spatial scales
* My research plan has changed quite a bit this semester, I have the research questions down but I'm hoping this class helps me find new ways to investigate those questions.
